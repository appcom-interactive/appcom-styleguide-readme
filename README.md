## Quotes
This section serves only one purpose: convince you of the need of a README! 

* "Once 6 months pass, a module without documentation begins to look new and unfamiliar." - https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme
* "No README means developers will need to delve into your code in order to understand it." - https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme
* By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on - http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html
* Also, end-user documentation is best when it doesn't assume that the user has any prior knowledge. The point in time when I'm closest to perfect lack of knowledge about something is before I've built it[2]. So, that's the best time to document it. - http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/documentation_first/
* It is a truth universally acknowledged that a developer in possession of a good program must be in want of good documentation. - https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/how-to-write-documentation-thats-actually-useful-1707.html
